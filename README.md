Firefighters  have  lately  faced  increasingly  difficulttime  in  combating  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  fires.This is largely due to the lack of information given or available.A  system  is  needed  to  provide  insightful  knowledge  and  statusof  the  fire.  We  propose  a  system  that  utilizes  a  web  applicationto help visualize real time data. This data would then be used totrack the origin of the fire, and the approximate extent of damage.This data would also be used to help predict how it would spreadgiven  an  estimated  time  of  arrival.  The  development  of  a  smartarray of sensors is also discussed. The technological infrastructurewill  be  outlined  in  the  following  proposal.
